<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arteriotomy Closure Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Closure Devices</li><li>Active Closure Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Arteriotomy closure devices are classified into two primary types: passive and active closure devices. Passive closure devices rely on natural processes such as coagulation and tissue healing to close the arteriotomy site, often utilizing materials like collagen or sutures. In contrast, active closure devices employ mechanical systems to facilitate immediate closure, using methods such as external compression or suturing mechanisms. Both types aim to minimize complications and promote faster recovery in patients undergoing vascular procedures.</p></p>
