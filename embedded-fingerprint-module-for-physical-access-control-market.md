<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Embedded Fingerprint Module for Physical Access Control Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capacitive Fingerprint Module</li><li>Optical Fingerprint Module</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Embedded fingerprint modules for physical access control primarily use two technologies: capacitive and optical fingerprint modules. Capacitive fingerprint modules work by measuring the electrical charge differences between a finger and the sensor surface, providing high accuracy and durability. In contrast, optical fingerprint modules capture an image of the fingerprint using light, which is effective but can be influenced by environmental factors. Both types enhance security by ensuring that only authenticated users gain access to restricted areas, making them integral to modern access control systems.</p></p>
