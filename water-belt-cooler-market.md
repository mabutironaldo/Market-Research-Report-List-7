<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Belt Cooler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Water Cycle</li><li>No Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Water belt coolers are classified into two main types: continuous water cycle and no loop systems. Continuous water cycle coolers utilize a steady flow of water that circulates through the cooling belt, providing efficient cooling by constantly removing heat. In contrast, no loop systems rely on a single supply of water that does not recirculate; instead, they cool the belt using a fixed volume of water, making them simpler but potentially less efficient for prolonged use. Both types serve specific cooling needs in various applications.</p></p>
